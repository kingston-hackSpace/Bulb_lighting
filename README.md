### Bulb Types : CODES

Every bulb type has unique characteristics represented by a letter, or series of letters, and a number, referred to as light bulb codes. These codes are located on the packaging and will help you determine if the bulb is the right type for your fixture.

### Bulb Holders

Bulb holders are not just a practical piece; it’s the electrical heart connecting your bulb to the power source. Choosing a holder that’s compatible with your bulb type and power configuration is essential to avoid short circuits or overheating, which could potentially lead to fires.

**PLASTIC OR METAL?**

PLASTIC fittings have no earth connection (two core wire only). They still need to be hundled under professional guidance due to electrical hazards. 

METAL fittings must always be connected via a flex with an earth wire due to electrical hazards. Metal fittings are not suitable in some locations – the most notable of which is bathrooms. Plastic ones may be used in bathrooms, but choose the type with a longer plastic shroud which shields the components better. In practice, metal lamp-holders are generally only used for certain types of table lamps.
